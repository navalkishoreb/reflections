How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff command displayed only the lines which have been modified in two version of files.
This helped in ignoring common text or code.
We only have to concentrate on changes that may have raised bug, since it was working as desired in the previous version.

Line by line comparison helps in evaluating changes that have been made.
We can compare and ponder what might have caused problem.

Like in example space and spacr.
